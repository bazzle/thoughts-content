Friend and family focus through the christmas period. Reflecting on 2025. Trying to plan the new year and outline my goals. I plan for the new year to be more productive than 2025 has been. The year things _really_ change for me. Really try to put into place the practice of _Kaizen_ —small incremental improvements that will compound to bring meaningful positive impacts on my life. Be less bothered about things I cannot control, have the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. (think I read that on someone's wall)

No specific things I can say I've done outside of a busy period in my day job and family chaos.
