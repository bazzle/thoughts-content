I flew out to Prague for the biggest European Bitcoin event! my first conference and surely not my last. These are the highlights.

* Seeing the familiar faces—various influencers, podcasters etc.
* Keynotes, particularly Jack Mallers. Saylor's almost rockstar-like reception from attendees.
* Hanging out with British plebs, some from the Canterbury meetup, some from the mini-conference I went to at cyphermunk house. One called Lord Snooty on X, had a number of drinks at a bar in the old town that accepts Bitcoin for payment.
* Attempted to explain Bitcoin to a Korean Keynesian economics ex-student. Didn't go well. We were talking past eachother.
* Absolutely hammering my lightning wallet. Used [Blitz wallet](https://blitz-wallet.com/).
* Loving the warm summer sun in Central Europe.
* Impressed by Prague, although old town is somewhat ruined by over-tourism.

Good chance I'll be back next year.
