Weather doesn't know what it's doing. Warm sun one minute, torrential rain the next.

- Bug fixes and improvements on Folkestone Fringe website. Mildly cursing at ProcessWire. Noticing how much of an accessibility hellscape this website front-end is.
- The above leading me to consider starting a business doing accessibility audits and remediations.
- Further styling updates on my website and this one.
- Found out they do complimentary coffee at my gym. So my evening work-out I can enjoy a nice double espresso! Being unable to sleep that night is an unfortunate side-effect.

Enjoyed walks along the coast listening to my favourite podcaster Knut Svanholm talking about Bitcoin (of course) and other things on Robert Breedlove's show. One point stood out and made me think.

How inflationary government issued paper currency is putting the brakes on what could be exponential productivity growth. 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 and so on. With taxes and inflation we don't even get to two. He doesn't go into much more depth on this but it has me thinking. If money was not inflationary, and there were no taxes, could productivity exponentially grow year on year?

I guess in the same way that there's a physical limit to how many times a piece of paper can be folded in half, Exponentials always hit a limit in nature, or the top of the S-curve. There's a limit to how much energy and resources can support this kind of growth. But we like to say that it would only take 42 folds for a piece of paper to hit the moon, how many years would it take for us to become a Type III civilisation? 42?
