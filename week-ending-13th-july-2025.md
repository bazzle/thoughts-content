Funny how Brits complain about heatwaves, when the temperature barely surpasses 27 degress. I say bring it on! This week I've been:

* Having the pleasure of unpicking an inherited website built in ProcessWire. I met up with the ladies at Folkestone Fringe and came out with a to-do list as long as my arm. After enough head scratching, var dumping and chatGPT interrogating, I think I'm nearly there.
* Spending a fair amount of time researching different accessibility certifications, and if I fancy going for them. Will it help me with my job and freelance prospects.
* Caught up with my longest friend Rob after a long while. He's an SEO and digital marketing expert aswell as an AI/vibe coding whizz. His productivity is incredible using tools like [https://bolt.new/](https://bolt.new/)
* Considering doing more with [satoshi-power.com](satoshi-power.com) adding a sat converter. Nice project to challenge myself with, asked Rob about what SEO keywords I could go for.
* Listened to a podcast with my favourite Bitcoin personality Knut Svanholm.
* Argued with buttcoiners on reddit for a bit of fun.

I'm done with ProcessWire! it is not a nice CMS to deal with. I really don't see why any agency would choose to use it and not another open-source one like WordPress.

Some incredible thought bombs from Knut. Particularly around inflation. How the natural state of the free market is deflation, prices go down, the productivity gain is absorbed by our inflationary system, where new printed wealth is funelled into the pockets of the cantillionaires. Nothing I haven't read about in his books, but great to hear again straight from the horses mouth. Knut called Bitcoin a "lovely little headfuck" what a legend.

Rob gave me the idea to use chatGPT to  challenge my Bitcoin conviction. Tell it to take the view of a sceptic and challenge me. I plan to do this when I get over my aversion to uncanny-valley AI.

Still so much on my to-do list.
