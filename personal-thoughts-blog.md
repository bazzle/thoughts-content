I plan to design and build a new blog site or website.

* Post weeknotes
* record my learning journey in web development
* talk economics, AI, disruptive technology
* bitcoin and self-sovereignty
* about anything really

It is to address my admittedly static web presence. My aim is to at the very least post a weeknote at the end of every week. I enjoy writing and I think with a shiny new website to use I'll be incentivised to keep this up.

It is also a nice excuse to get experience building in React/Next.JS. And using a headless CMS. As I've been stuck to WordPress for the most part, these concepts are new to me.

Breaking it down:

* Will build in next.JS
* Deploy to Netlify
* Use Decap for content (formerly Netlify CMS)

Also I want to develop the styles I used for my portfolio site into its own style library, contain it in a repo which can be added to this repo as a submodule. And added to my portfolio site in the same way.
