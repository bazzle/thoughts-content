We're having the kind of weather that is not conducive to leaving the house.

* Migrated [Bitcoin Truthbombs](https://bitcoin-truthbombs.com/) from a WordPress instance to a static site using 11ty and hosted on Netlify. Used a plugin called WordDown to export the posts to markdown files. Had to get to grips with nunjucks which I found a bit of a challenge. The syntax is unfamiliar. Codex helped me out greatly for repetitive tasks.
* Looked for some opportunities at Bitcoin companies, sent off an application.
* Learned about Declarative vs Imperative programming.
* Discovered this cool desktop app for playing with JS - [RunJS](https://runjs.app/)
