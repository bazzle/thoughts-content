## Background

BFI are the UK's leading organisation for film and the moving image. A charity which nurtures and promotes home-grown talent, establishes several programmes and festivals aswell as maintain the world's biggest film and television archive.

BFI's ten-year strategy, Screen Culture 2033, sets out a long-term vision for sustaining UK screen culture through major technological and social change. It broadens the focus beyond film alone. Prioritising access, diversity, skills and digital delivery to ensure screen culture remains creative, inclusive and resilient to 2033 and beyond.

BFI approached us to develop a campaign website separate from the main BFI site. To contain long strategy documents as accessible html. Aswell as supporting articles and blog posts.

## Involvement

* Working closely with BFI's in-house graphic designer, and delivery lead, I designed the homepage and internal pages.
* Front-end implementation of the build working with a full-stack developer to deliver the WordPress theme.
* Content editor assistance and handover to BFI digital team.

## Language and feel

Striking typography together with the brand pink colour and purple for accents, liberal use of white-space. Powerful and emotive stills and clips from films. Content focussing on the bold aims of the organisation over the subsequent decade, inclusive to cater for the diversity of people who enjoy British films.

## Challenges

* **Navigation** Recreate the main navigation drop-down pattern used on the main BFI website, in behaviour and appearance.

* **Website Information Architecture** Through discovery sessions with the client, we realised we needed a relatively deep structure defined by parent pillar pages, _long read_ pages which present reports and/or strategy outlines and child pages which are sections of those reports. The latter navigable via the _long-read_ nav component.

## Outcome

We delivered the campaign site in time for BFI's 10 year strategy launch. The campaign launch was a success, with the campaign site being shared widely amongst the press and public. BFI have since integrated the campaign site into their main website architecture.
