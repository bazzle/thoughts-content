## Rationale

BFI's ten-year strategy, Screen Culture 2033, sets out a long-term vision for sustaining UK screen culture through major technological and social change. It broadens the focus beyond film alone. Prioritising access, diversity, skills and digital delivery to ensure screen culture remains creative, inclusive and resilient to 2033 and beyond.

BFI approached us to develop a campaign website separate from the main BFI site. To contain long strategy documents as accessible html. Aswell as supporting articles and blog posts.

## Involvement

* Working closely with BFI's in-house graphic designer, I designed the homepage and internal pages.
* Regular check-ins with the product manager.
* Front-end implementation of the build, working with a back-end developer.

## Language and feel

Heavy striking typography against the brand pink colour, liberal use of white-space, powerful stills and clips from films. Content with a focus on inclusivity, reflecting the diversity of people who enjoy British films, and the subjects the British film industry covers.

* **Content accessibility and structure** To make the nested strategy document structures, and long lengths of text easily navigable and accessible. Part of the reason BFI chose GovPress to work with, was because we used a "long-read" pattern on another website we built ([National Audit Office](https://www.nao.org.uk/)). I had to adapt this pattern because the document navigation needed to link to subpages, aswell as headings on the pages, as opposed to NAO which only links to headings on the page.
* **Navigation** I had to recreate the main navigation drop-down pattern used on the main BFI website, in behaviour and appearance.
* **Client training** The editor needed some training on how to structure the content into pages and headings, which define points the user can jump to via the long-read navigation.
