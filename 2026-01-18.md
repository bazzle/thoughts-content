Physically and mephorically clearing out the residual waste from 2025

* Introduced myself on the Bitcoin design community on Discord, sat on the call with Mat Balez about the communities initiatives for 2026
* Further iteration of my mobile screenshot viewer component, as can be [seen here](/thoughts/2025-12-11/#dedicated-currency-screen-with-converter-tool)
* Clearing out checklist of mundane personal admin tasks.
* Similarly clearing out the rain soaked, wind battered chaos of our balcony. Piling up the twisted wreckage of the fake bamboo fence into a pile.
