Feeling like we're speeding towards winter. Summer seems to be fading fast. Chillier days and darker evenings. Autumn equinox is just around the corner now. 

* Been spending a lot of time following the Core vs Knots Bitcoin client implementation drama. Have been consuming countless hours of Bitcoin podcasts.  Planning to get my thoughts down here at some point. I'm glad Knots is gaining ground over Core—currently around 25% of the node network. Proud to be running Knots myself on my Umbrel.
* Rebuilt [Satoshi Power](https://satoshi-power.com/) in Next.js. Have some plans in mind for that website, so wrote up a roadmap on the readme for the project.
* Doing dead-hangs daily, along with my press-ups. Can manage 45 seconds. Feel the limiting factor is the lack of strength in my fingers.
* Started my second read through of Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy. Apparently jumping into hyperspace is unpleasant, like getting drunk—if you're wondering why getting drunk should be unpleasant, ask a glass of water. 😂
