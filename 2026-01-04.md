Preparing to get back to reality after the excesses of the christmas and New Year period.

* Valuarchy—Over the course of a day, I designed and put together a single-page website for an acquaintance and fellow Bitcoiner, who has a novel idea for a new electoral process, named _Valuarchy_. A single page site to download the explainer book. Built in 11ty, with an embedded blink Bitcoin donation widget. Hopefully I'll get the opportunity to build on this further. — (Valuarchy)[https://valuarchy.com/]
