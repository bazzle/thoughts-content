I’ve taken a hiatus, mainly because I’ve been occupied by personal matters. My wife’s visa renewal is one thing that’s taken my time, money and a part of my sanity 😭 There is a lot that needs to be said about the user experience presented by UK Visa’s and Immigration.

Aside from that I’ve been:

1. Thinking about my personal brand. Who I am, what I do and how best to present myself, wrote an article about what a _Design Tinkerer_ is
2. Continuing to educate myself on React and Next.js
3. Completing phase 3 of [Satoshi Power](https://satoshi-power.com)
4. Trying out different AI language models and tools. Dropping Codex (ChatGPT) in favour of Grok code. Mainly due to money reasons (lack of) preferring the latter model where you pay per token, rather than monthly subscription
5. Keeping up to date with Bitcoin Core vs Knots, consuming podcasts and articles like a fat kid eats cake
6. Refurbishing my old 2013 macbook pro (new battery and trackpad) and installing Ubuntu on it. (as it can’t run any MacOS’s that are still maintained)
