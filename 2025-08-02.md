One thing that struck me when I began researching Bitcoin is all of the different places the research took me. I was expecting to learn primarily about cryptography and about Bitcoin from a technical perspective. But I learned so much more about money, the evolution of money, and its characteristics. As well as how inflationary money affects so many things in society, different economic models, incentives, and how **Bitcoin fixes this**

There's the technical aspect, the economic and the philosophical. It is not so much "going down *the* Bitcoin rabbit hole" more like going down *multiple* rabbit holes.

Another part of this, the community online popularise memes and phrases that become part of the culure. Like HODL, aswell as lifestyle choices like having a low *Time preference.*

So I thought of the idea of 2 minute reads, easy to digest overviews of these concepts. So I developed a WordPress website, designed and built from ground-up using my own naked starter theme [Sapling](https://github.com/bazzle/sapling).

There's not a huge amount to say about the design. I jumped between a few different design options—font pairings and colour pallettes. Landing on an aesthetic I often go for—neon, cyberpunk style with black background, and light foreground colours to create a striking contrast. Along with MidJourney generated images. I settled for Bebas again as the display font. (you make have noted that I used Bebas also for [Satoshi-power](https://satoshi-power.com/))

A very Bitcoin-centric quirk on the site, is the use of *Block height* to indicate when the article was published, alongside the conventionally understood date. In the Bitcoin space, blog articles, podcasts and other resources often use block height to indicate the time of publication. It goes into a particularly esoteric rabbit hole about how the blockchain, or timechain presents digitally native time for the first time. A subject thoroughly dissected by Gigi in his article [Bitcoin is time](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/).

### Retrospective

I created the website without a plan to properly get it out there. It's more an outlet to write about concepts I found particularly compelling, as part of my research and learning more than anything. I moved onto other things now.

At some point in the future I plan to continue writing and possibly get the writing out there on socials, to see if it gains any traction.
