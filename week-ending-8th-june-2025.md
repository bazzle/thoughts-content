* Test Driven Development exercises at work. Working on a kata to write tests for a WordPress shortcode
* Dived back into React/NextJS after a bit of a hiatus
* Added nostr npub to this website footer. Adapted from the component on [satoshi-power](https://satoshi-power.com/). From this I can see why React and JSX exist. satoshi-power is a JS only app, built in vanilla JS. It was a pain having to build DOM nodes using \`createElement\` and other methods. JSX, you can markup your component much more intuitively.
* Another typographical update to my style library, which I use for [br-web.me](br-web.me) and this site. Dropped the serif font for everything but body text in articles
* Checked off and deployed v1.2 of this blog site
* Played around with [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/). Had it code up a feature to introduce tag archive pages
* Ordered Elliot Jay Stocks book—[Universal Principles of Typography](https://elliotjaystocks.com/book)
* Wrote an article about my [relationship with AI](/my-relationship-with-ai)
* Booked my flight to Prague for BTC Prague!
* Enjoyed some nice early summer weather.
