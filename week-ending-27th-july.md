Nothing much to report on this week. Was a quiet one. Did a lot of boring personal admin, swore a lot at various apps' clear interaction design failures, while I migrated to a new phone and new number. Many of them sending me into 2FA circle of doom. A fair amount of reflecting and figuring out where I want my career to go next.
